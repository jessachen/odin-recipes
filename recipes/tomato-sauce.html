        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is perhaps the most famous recipe created by Marcella Hazan, 
            the cookbook author who changed how Americans cook Italian food. 
            It also may be her easiest. Use your favorite canned tomatoes for this
            and donâ€™t be scared off by the butter. It gives the sauce an unparalleled velvety richness.</p>
