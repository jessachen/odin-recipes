        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Cilbir, pronounced “chulburr”, is a revelation and a complete sensation.</p>

        <p>If you can’t get the Aleppo pepper, also known as pul biber or Turkish red pepper 
            flakes, which has a mild, almost sweet heat and a distinctive lemoniness, you could 
            substitute paprika, adding a pinch of dried chilli flakes.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup Greek yoghurt</li>
