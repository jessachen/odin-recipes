        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>If I hadn’t eaten the Turkish eggs at Peter Gordon’s restaurant, The Providores, I most certainly wouldn’t 
            be tempted by the idea of poached eggs on Greek yogurt. I say that only to pre-empt any hesitancy on your part. 
            For çilbir, pronounced “chulburr”, is a revelation and a complete sensation.</p>

        <p>If you can’t get the Aleppo pepper, also known as pul biber or Turkish red pepper flakes, which has a mild, almost 
            sweet heat and a distinctive lemoniness, you could substitute paprika, adding a pinch of dried chilli flakes. But, 
            in these days of online grocery shopping, I’d encourage you to go for the real thing. This is the recipe that helped 
            me overcome my fear of poaching eggs (see additional info below).</p>
        
            <p>As featured in Nigella's book, <em>At my Table</em></p>

        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup Greek yoghurt</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic (peeled and minced)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 x 15ml tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 x 15ml tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper / Turkish red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 large eggs (fridge-cold)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>a few fronds fresh dill (chopped)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a wide-ish saucepan (I use one of 22cm diameter) with water to come about 4cm 
                up the sides of the pan. Put it on the heat and cover so that it heats up faster. 
                Line a large plate with some kitchen roll, get out a slotted spoon, and put both near the pan now.</li>
            <li>Now fill another pan – on which a heatproof bowl can sit comfortably – again with water to come 3–4cm up
                 the sides, and bring to the boil. Put the yogurt in said bowl, stir in the garlic and salt, and sit it 
                 on top of this pan, making sure the base of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Stir it until it gets to 
                 body temperature and has the consistency of lightly whipped double cream. Turn off the heat and leave the bowl 
                 as it is, over the pan.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter gently in a small pan until it is just beginning to turn a hazelnutty brown (this is why, 
                in classic French cuisine, it’s known as beurre noisette), but make sure it’s not actually burning. Turn the 
                heat off under the pan, then stir in the olive oil, followed by the beautiful red pepper flakes; it will foam up fierily. 
                Leave to one side while you get on with the eggs. And this is when you should be thinking of putting the toast on.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to poach the eggs, crack the first egg into a finemesh strainer suspended over a small bowl, then lift 
                it up a little and swirl gently for about 30 seconds, letting the watery part of the white drip into the bowl. Gently tip 
                the egg into a small cup or ramekin and, aiming for the white, add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice; I know everyone else says vinegar, 
                but I just don’t like the taste of it on the egg, and the lemon does the trick just the same. Proceed as above with the second egg.</li>
            <li>When the poaching water is just starting to simmer, take a cup or ramekin in each hand and gently slide in the eggs, one on each side 
                of the pan. Turn the heat right down so there is no movement in the water whatsoever, and poach the eggs for 3–4 minutes until the whites 
                are set and the yolks still runny. Transfer the eggs with your slotted spoon to the paper-lined plate to remove any excess water. Do remember 
                to switch off the heat. Sorry to state the obvious, but I have too often left it on this low without noticing.</li>
            <li>Divide the warm creamy yogurt between two shallow bowls, top each with a poached egg, pour the peppery butter around and slightly over the yogurt, 
                scatter the chopped dill on top, and eat dreamily, dipping in some thick well-toasted bread as you do so.</li>
            
        </ol>
