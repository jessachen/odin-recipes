        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Ratatouille is a southern French dish of stewed vegetables—commonly featuring eggplant, sweet peppers, 
            summer squash, garlic, onion, and tender green herbs, in a tomato-based sauce. 
            This version, as we know it, only came about around 200 years ago. Before that, 
            “ratatouille” merely referred to a chunky vegetable stew.
        </p>

       <p>This Genius ratatouille recipe from Alice Waters' 2007 cookbook <em>The Art of Simple Food</em> 
          fusses only where it needs to fuss (over the eggplant), and adds a few smart, 
          modern details—red chile flakes, a basil bouquet—that improve on a well-worn classic. 
          Plus, it’s ratio is easy to remember: All vegetables conveniently work out to about a pound.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 medium or 2 small eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>4 to 6 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 bunch basil, tied in a bouquet with kitchen twine + 6 basil leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pinch dried chile flakes</li>
            <li>2 sweet peppers, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>3 medium summer squash, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>3 ripe medium tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion 
                halves in a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt.</li>
            <li>Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, 
                for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces 
                of tomato with a spoon. Add salt as needed.</li>
            <li>Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe 
                makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.</li>
        </ol>
