        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Ratatouille is a southern French dish of stewed vegetables—commonly featuring eggplant, sweet peppers, 
            summer squash, garlic, onion, and tender green herbs, in a tomato-based sauce. 
            This version, as we know it, only came about around 200 years ago. Before that, 
            “ratatouille” merely referred to a chunky vegetable stew.
        </p>

       <p>This Genius ratatouille recipe from Alice Waters' 2007 cookbook <em>The Art of Simple Food</em> 
          fusses only where it needs to fuss (over the eggplant), and adds a few smart, 
          modern details—red chile flakes, a basil bouquet—that improve on a well-worn classic. 
          Plus, it’s ratio is easy to remember: All vegetables conveniently work out to about a pound.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 medium or 2 small eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>4 to 6 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 bunch basil, tied in a bouquet with kitchen twine + 6 basil leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pinch dried chile flakes</li>
            <li>2 sweet peppers, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>3 medium summer squash, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>3 ripe medium tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Toss the eggplant cubes with a teaspoon or so of salt. Set the cubes in a colander to drain for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Pat the eggplant dry, add to the pan, and cook over medium
                 heat, stirring frequently, until golden. Add a bit more oil if the eggplant absorbs all the oil and sticks to the 
                 bottom of the pan. Remove the eggplant when done and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, pour in 2 more tablespoons olive oil. Add onions and cook for about 7 minutes, 
                or until soft and translucent. Add the garlic, basil bouquet, dried chile flakes, and a bit more salt.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, then stir in peppers. Cook for a few more minutes, then stir in summer squash. 
                Cook for a few more minutes, then stir in tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Cook for 10 minutes longer, then stir in eggplant and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, until all the vegetables 
                are soft. Remove the bouquet of basil, pressing on it to extract all its flavors, and adjust the seasoning with salt.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chopped basil leaves and more extra virgin olive oil, to taste. Serve warm or cold.</li>
        </ol>
